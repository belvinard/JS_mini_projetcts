Project 1

Several skills stand out from this code:

HTML: The code utilizes HTML to structure the webpage. It includes basic HTML elements such as , , , <title>, , and . These elements are essential for defining the document's structure, metadata, title, and linking to external resources.

CSS: Although not directly shown in this code snippet, there's a reference to an external CSS file (mini-calendar.css). This implies that CSS is likely used to style the elements within the webpage, even though the specific styling rules are not visible in this snippet.

JavaScript: The code contains a JavaScript block embedded within the HTML document. JavaScript is used to dynamically update the content of specific HTML elements (

tags) based on the current date obtained from the JavaScript Date object.

DOM Manipulation: The JavaScript code selects HTML elements by their IDs (getElementById) and dynamically updates their content (innerHTML) based on the current date obtained from the Date object. This demonstrates proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements on the webpage.

Date Object: The code effectively utilizes the JavaScript Date object to obtain the current date, day of the week, month, and year. It then formats and displays this information within the corresponding HTML elements.

Conditional (Ternary) Operator: The code uses a ternary operator ((today.getDate() < 10 ? "0" : "")) to add a leading zero to the date if it's a single-digit number. This demonstrates an understanding of conditional logic in JavaScript.

Overall, the code showcases proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with skills in DOM manipulation, working with the Date object, and using conditional operators in JavaScript.


Project 2

Several skills and concepts stand out:


1. HTML Structure and Semantics:

Understanding and using HTML tags (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, <link>, <body>, <div>, <img>, <form>, <input>, <label>, <span>, <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>) to structure the webpage and provide semantic meaning to content.
CSS Linking:

2. Linking external CSS stylesheets (<link rel="stylesheet" href="product-page.css">) to apply additional styling to the HTML elements.
Responsive Design:

Using <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> to ensure the webpage is responsive and adjusts to different device screen sizes.
CSS Framework Integration:

3. Integrating Font Awesome icons with <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css"> to enhance the design with iconography.
Form Handling:

Implementing a form (<form>) with various input types (<input type="radio">, <input type="number">) to gather user input (size, color, quantity) and potentially process it.
Event Handling in JavaScript:

4. Using JavaScript (<script>) to handle events (e.g., clicking on buttons) and dynamically change content on the page (changing product images based on button clicks).
DOM Manipulation:

Accessing and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript (document.getElementById, document.getElementsByClassName, element.classList, element.onclick) to update elements and respond to user interactions dynamically.
Looping and Array Methods:

5. Utilizing JavaScript array methods (Array.from(), forEach()) to convert and iterate through HTML collections (such as btn) and perform operations on each element efficiently.
Commenting and Debugging:

6. Commenting out sections of code (/* */) for debugging or testing purposes, demonstrating an understanding of code organization and troubleshooting techniques.
Version Control and Collaboration:

Incorporating the code into a version control system like Git to manage changes, collaborate with others, and track project history effectively.
These skills collectively showcase proficiency in front-end web development, including HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript event handling, and DOM manipulation. They are fundamental for building interactive and responsive web applications.



Project 3

Several skills and concepts are highlighted:

1.DOM Manipulation:

Accessing and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using methods like document.getElementById, createElement, appendChild, innerHTML, and classList.toggle. These are used to dynamically create and modify HTML elements based on user actions.

2. Event Handling:
Using event listeners (addEventListener) to respond to user interactions such as clicking on list items (LI) or their child elements (SPAN). This allows for interactive functionality where tasks can be marked as completed (checked) or deleted (remove).

4. Conditional Statements:
Employing if-else statements to validate user input (inputBox.value === '') before adding a task. This ensures that the user is prompted with an alert if they attempt to add an empty task.

5. Local Storage:
Utilizing localStorage to persist data locally within the browser. Data is stored and retrieved using localStorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem, respectively. This feature ensures that tasks added by the user remain saved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

6. Function Definitions:
Defining functions (addTask, saveData, showTask) to encapsulate specific functionalities. This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability by separating different aspects of the application logic.

7. Initial Data Display:
Calling showTask() function to initially display tasks stored in localStorage when the page loads (listContainer.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("data")). This ensures that previously saved tasks are rendered on the page upon revisiting the application.

8. Unicode Character:
Using Unicode ("\u00d7") to display a cross (âœ—) symbol within each task item, typically indicating a delete action. This enhances user experience by providing visual cues for task management.

9. Error Handling:
Implementing basic error handling through if conditions to ensure that tasks cannot be added with empty content, preventing potential user mistakes or incomplete entries.
These skills collectively demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript for web development, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, local data storage, and maintaining application state across sessions. They are essential for building interactive and responsive web applications that provide a seamless user experience.
